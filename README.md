# Capture The Feather

Capture the Feather is a capture the flag platform that will focus on the learning aspect of these competitions. Whether you're a beginner, a college student currently learning cybersecurity fundamentials, or a pro who wants to challenge themselves, this platform can provide learning experiences to all of you.

As a capture the flag platform, users will be able to sign up for the platform and try to complete cybersecurtity challenges created by an administrator. These challenges could range from simple web challenges to reverse engineering challenges. Users and admin will be able to keep track of who completes challenges the quickest and who has the most points.

## Timeline of Completion

_For each milestone, I will add some unit tests to backend code only as it will contain the most logic._

**Milestone 1 - Due Feb 26 by 11:59pm**
For Milestone 1, the plan is to finish the basic functionality of the platform for non-admins. This includes viewing challenges, solving challenging, and being a part of a leaderboard.

**Milestone 2 - Due Mar 25 by 12:59am**
For Milestone 2, the plan is to finish the basic functionality of the platform for admins. This will include creating challenges, editing challenges, deleting challenges, and managing users.

**Milestone 3 - Due Apr 15 by 12:59am**
For Milestone 3, the plan is to create an event/challenge exporter and uploader. This will only include the format created by our platform. If time permits, I may begin to look into how to create a challenge importer for other platforms.
